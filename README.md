alientube (Alpha)
=========

A Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension that embeds Reddit comments, in your YouTube!

This is a _work in progress_ and there may be issues. It will eventually support voting and commenting.  
  
_Instructions:_  
OS X/Linux:  
Run chmod +x setup.sh in terminal to give the file executable rights.  
Run setup.sh to create hardlinks for javascript files commonly shared between browser extensions.  
  
Windows:  
Run setup.cmd to create symlinks for javascript files commonly shared between browser extensions.  

  
If you have no idea what I just said then you probably shouldn't be here.
