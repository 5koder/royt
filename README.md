alientube (Alpha)
=========

A Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension that embeds Reddit comments, in your YouTube!

This is a _work in progress_ and there may be issues. It will eventually support voting and commenting.  
  
Instructions
-------------
__OS X/Linux:__  
Run chmod +x setup.sh in terminal to give the file executable rights.  
Run setup.sh to create hardlinks for files commonly shared between browser extensions.  
  
__Windows:__  
Run setup.cmd to create symlinks for files commonly shared between browser extensions.  


Running compile.py will automatically generate a minified production version for release.
